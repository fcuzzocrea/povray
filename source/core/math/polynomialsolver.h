/// @def MAX_ORDER
/// Maximum supported polynomial order.
///
/// @todo
///     This currently carries a large, fixed per polysolve() call
///     memory allocation on the stack. Size is on the order of
///     (MAX_ORDER+1)*int + PRECISE_FLOAT * (MAX_ORDER+1)^2
///     which impacts performance and performance stability especially
///     for threads > cores. Allocation based on current equation order
///     would be better. My C++ attempts at this all badly slower. C itself
///     supports a struct "flexible array member" feature, however this
///     not a C++11 standard though some C++ compilers support it.
///
#define MAX_ORDER 35

/// @todo
///     With the elimination of the Solve_Polynomial wrapper we are no longer
///     setting stats[Polynomials_Tested] and stats[Roots_Eliminated]. Note both
///     long inaccurate. The first never capturing anything close to the actual
///     polynomials solved for roots. Rather only calls to Solve_Polynomial. The
///     roots eliminated value was entirely inaccurate with respect to roots
///     eliminated and rather reflected one of a few ways coefficients were
///     being changed ahead of the actual solver work. Currently leaving the
///     stats infrastructure there with the thought both could be restored more
///     accurately, but truthfully doubt there would ever be any actual value to
///     users or developers.
///

/// @remark
///     The coefficient order for the polynomial when calling any function defined
///     herein is:
///
///         c[0] * x ^ n + c[1] * x ^ (n-1) + ... + c[n-1] * x + c[n] = 0
